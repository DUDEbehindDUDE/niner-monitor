# Niner Monitor

This project aims to be a dashboard style website that serves as a one-stop shop for you to look at most of the things you'll want to know about UNC Charlotte, including how busy places are, what's open, and more. This project was heavily inspired by a discord bot showing occupancy levels made by `@ironton` on discord.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About the Site

You can access the site at [https://dudebehinddude.github.io/niner-monitor/](https://dudebehinddude.github.io/niner-monitor/). The site is built using React, and occupancy data is gathered from other sites through an external API. The code for this API can be found [here](https://github.com/dudebehinddude/niner-monitor-api/).
